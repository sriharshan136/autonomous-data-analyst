# Autonomous Data Analyst ðŸ¤–ðŸ“Š

This project is an AI-powered data analyst that uses a LangChain agent to analyze data from CSV files. It can understand natural language questions, perform complex analysis using a variety of tools, and generate insights on the fly.

## Features

- **Interactive Chat**: Ask questions and guide the analysis in a conversational way.
- **Multi-Tool Agent**: The agent has access to a variety of tools, including:
  - A powerful **Pandas DataFrame** tool for general data queries.
  - A custom **Outlier Detector** to find anomalies in the data.
  - A **Report Saver** to write findings to a text file.
- **Modular & Organized**: The project is structured with separate directories for tools and agent logic, making it easy to extend.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a modular structure for better maintainability:

```
autonomous-data-analyst/
â”œâ”€â”€ input/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ sales_data.csv
â”œâ”€â”€ reports/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ (created by the agent)
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ custom_tools.py
â”œâ”€â”€ agent/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ __init__.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ agent_creator.py
â”œâ”€â”€ .gitignore
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”œâ”€â”€ main.py
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

## Setup & Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd autonomous-data-analyst
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Hugging Face API token:
    ```env
    HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN='your_hf_token_here'
    ```

## How to Run

Run the main application from your terminal. The script will load the data and initialize the agent.

```bash
python main.py
```

Once the `ðŸ¤– AI Data Analyst is ready...` message appears, you can start asking questions.

### Example Queries

Here are a few things you can ask the agent:

- `What is the total sales for each region?`
- `Detect outliers in the 'quantity' column.`
- `Summarize the data and then save the report.`
- `What is the average unit_price for Laptops?`

Type `exit` to end the session.
